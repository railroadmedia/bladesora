        <p class="font-bold">Privacy Policy</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Below is a list of the standard policies we use on this website. They are in place to safeguard our users, and to ensure we can provide a quality user experience!</p>

        <p class="font-bold">Standard Website Logs</p>
        <p class="mb-3">The {{ ucwords($brand) }} website logs all website visitors and transactions. We collect the standard information most all websites collect such as: the type of browser you are using, your IP address, your ISPs domain, time of day, date, web pages viewed, and length of time that you spend visiting this site, what forms were filled out, and what you purchase on our website. This data is logged on our servers through Google™ Analytics and Intercom™ for internal use only. We won't share any of the information outside of our company.</p>

        <p class="font-bold">Subscriptions & E-mail Data</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Our website offers users the option to subscribe for periodical updates. This is done with a name and e-mail address for registration. As with our server logs – all information that is collected will never be shared with any 3rd party.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">In addition, all outgoing e-mail contains our mailing address and a simple unsubscribe link that can be used by the recipient to remove themselves from our mailing list. Once removed – you will no longer get any e-mail from us. </p>

        <p class="font-bold">IP Logging</p>
        <p class="mb-3">We use visitor IP information to assist in diagnosing possible problems encountered on our web servers. If there is a future contention, then at least we have records on hand. In addition, an IP address can be used to gather a wide range of demographic information; again, this data is kept internal.</p>

        <p class="font-bold">Cookies</p>
        <p class="mb-3">We use cookies to track basic website information. This data can be used to be sure affiliate partners are recognized for visitors they send to this website, or for tracking our marketing campaigns. We do not share any cookie information with 3rd parties.</p>

        <p class="font-bold">External Links</p>
        <p class="mb-3">This website contains some links to external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these web destinations. You are encouraged to read the individual privacy policies of those websites to be sure they match our high standards.</p>

        <p class="font-bold">Customers</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Those that buy products on this website are asked for additional information. This data is used to process each sale, and to mail out each order to the correct customer. We keep records of customer data including: name, street address, e-mail address, phone number, and other contact information. However, we do NOT hold credit card data of any kind. Our credit card processing partner Stripe™ manages all of that information. In some cases we have the ability to see the last 4-5 digits of a credit card for future client verification. We do not receive any credit card or banking information if you choose to pay through PayPal™.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Customers that have purchased from us are also added to our mailing-list by default. However, as stated above – all outgoing e-mail contains a simple unsubscribe link that can be used by the recipient at anytime.</p>

        <p class="font-bold">Changes to this Policy</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Please note that basic changes to this policy can be done at any time.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">We pride ourselves on taking every precaution necessary to ensure our users are safe and secure while browsing our website. This is why we have developed a privacy policy that covers how we collect, and store your information.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Please contact support if you have any questions that aren't answered here.</p>
